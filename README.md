# cnaas-setup
CNaaS setup script

Download the script and run it from a machine that has access to the NMS API:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SUNET/cnaas-setup/master/cnaas-setup.sh

This will guide you through setting up some initial settings for your CNaaS
environment to get you started with the first two distribution switches that
are connected to your server setup.
